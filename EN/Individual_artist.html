                <p>To me, ghosts are blue. They are physically complete from the outside, but extremely light on the inside.</p>
                <p>In this work, I used the photograms of the plastic flowers to make the flower the ghost of itself. Between the translucent skin and the dangling body, I questioned the difference between these ghosts and myself: Is there actually no boundary between humans and objects, life and non-life?</p>

                <h2>Chiu Ching Ting</h2>
                <p>I walked into Zhongli Houliao at the end of 2020, It is also my first fieldwork research experience. I saw that the dividing grid line would cross the palm-printed place and the house where the doors and windows were removed. I just met this place at the time but faced the situation that it was about to disappear.Therefore, it has always been not a question of forgetting and leaving, but a question of how to stay and respond in a place that is about to disappear, in a place where nothing can be recognized when I first encounter.</p>
                <p>After months of quarantine due to the epidemic, a kind of future described by the construction site wall, has used the methods of demolition and excavation, so that the recognized road is gone, and the entry is always blocked.The "imperfect image" produced with destruction and excessive toning means that it is not the identity of the resident and the time when the current situation cannot be changed when entering Houliao. Enter the scene with perceptual creative techniques to create a space where emotions and memories can be placed. The imperfect scattering can still be a clue to the gathering, and so far I have no intention of forgetting the silhouette of the Houliao, the possible visualization for not leaving.</p>

                <h2>Medwin Hsu</h2>
                <p>Come what may, we carry on with our life.  Freshly off the boat, we found ourselves with a bit of an issue.  The best spots were already spoken for.  With all the fertile plains taken, we made do with what we got by venturing deeper into the mountains.  We were getting by with the fruits we planted and the trees we chopped down.  Our home slowly formed along the river terrace.  When the government packed up the logging industry and shut down our sole train line to the outside world, we might as well start driving more.  At least we didn’t need to mind the overloaded lorries traveling up and down our roads.  After the earthquake stroke, familiar streets were reduced to rubbles.  The dead choked our morgue.  Once more, we were at a loss?  But, as long as we are still kicking, we could clear the debris and bid farewell to our dearly departed.  Part with our friends who, perhaps wisely, no longer wished to stay in this town.   After all that, we kept calm and carried on.  Without us ever noticing, the years zoomed by.

                <p>On May 19, 2021, due to the aggravation of the epidemic in Taiwan, the government announced a three-level alert. With the spread of the epidemic, government control, and media exaggeration, the typhoon screamed like the whole people "going to jail" and lost their personal freedom, and the dormitory has become my "prison"
                </p>
                <p><b>〈Occupy Quadruple Room〉</b></p>
                <p>All the roommates in the same dormitory room returned home to avoid the epidemic, and finally enjoyed the dormitory room exclusively! The dormitory is located in the essence of Tianlong Country in Da'an District, only five minutes from the MRT station. The layout is square, the ventilation inside and outside the room is excellent, 16 square meters are actively suitable for singles, bring your own furniture and rent 9900 NTD per semester, immediately enter the owner.

                <p>Can't be used for dinner? Worried about getting a virus when you go out? It's okay, three meals with alcohol and natural environmental sounds, you can be as free as a picnic in the dormitory.</p>

                <p>藉由觀看他人，最終得以觀看自己，一方面像圖鑑、紀錄性質的觀看，另一方面引起我與他/她的思考: 我是誰？什麼事物構成我？其他人又是什麼樣子？我們的關係是什麼？ 以較長遠的眼光視之，算是我完整我在此時人生階段的其中一步吧。</p>

                <p>When we were young, we always had some form of inner rebel that liked to question or do the opposite of what we were told. At that time, we craved independence and autonomy. We wanted to be the ones calling the shots and making the rules. Nevertheless, when we grew up, the ideas we held when we were young seemed to gradually change. Consider your desire for freedom—— the need to live your life in an authentic way, and the rules and regulations of society—— which is more important to you?</p>
